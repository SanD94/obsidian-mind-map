# Javascript

In JS, strings are immutable which means they cannot be altered. In order to change a string variable you need to reassing it with a different string literal.

push and pop functions can use for arrays in JS similar to queue structure in C++. shift and unshift function are similar to pop and push functions for stack structure.

`const` and `let` behave differently from their names suggest. `const` declaration makes a variable constant if the variable is primitive but if it is array or object, the variable can be mutated but a new object or array cannot be assigned. You can think of the behavior as a constant behavior of address assignment. `let` declaration makes the variable be defined in a block scope rather than global scope.
