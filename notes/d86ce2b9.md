# Random Thoughts

I try to explain some of thoughts in English but I know that it is not enough for me to explain all of my thoughts, which dwell in Turkish, in English. The main reason for that is there are some expressions or statement that cannot be translated between languages. The context may be explained but not the structure itself. If what you represent in your mind has meaning with its syntax or structure, then there isn't any one to one good translation or expression. There are just answers that convince us they are correct. What I'm thinking is similar to the one I explained here but there is more. Language is itself has a different notion when thinking of it from different angles. In the end, I may make my decision to explain what I have in mind in different languages without having any problem, which is a totally different issue right now. I will write what I have in English in English and what I have in Turkish in Turkish. That's all.

I like to read Tom Stafford's writings. He wrote about ethical reasoning by giving some explanations from his readings. Ethical reasoning, according to Singer, began as justification. Justification implies an audience. But, Singer argues, the very act of justification requires adopting a "disinterested stance", and a disinterested stance is the trigger for a chain reaction.

The capacity to reason is a special sort of capacity because it can lead us to places we did not expect to go. Comparing ability to write and ability to reason may give us some understanding about the topic. Since reasoning does not depend on time and space, we cannot predict what would happen if we follow the chain reaction caused by reasoning. Another possibility is the reasoning we have at a time `t` leads us to think one argument as sound but it is not the case when we have different reasoning at a time `t+1`. I may have a drop a position I formerly held, even abandon a project I find I cannot complete. Matters
