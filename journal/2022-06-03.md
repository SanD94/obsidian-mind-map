Learning S3, S4, and R6 is required if there is any class implementation needed. Other than that, knowing them gives the theoretical knowledge to understand how these three types works.

Advanced R book explains general functions, how R works generally, metaprogramming, OOP paradigms, classes and their conventions for R. From a C++ developer's side, the book does not have so much detail in itself especially for metaprogramming and OOP paradigms. The obvious difference comes from how R works. Having an environment and local scoping system, R gets its power from these structures and rules.
