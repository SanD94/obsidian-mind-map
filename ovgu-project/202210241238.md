Data format needs to be adapted for machine learning. Our data at hand do not have fix dimensions because participants complete trials in different durations. In order for us to have them fixed, we used data augmentation and data sampling.

Generally, we experimented with two different types of data. One is navigation data with same dimension after preprocessing, another is navigation image generated with navigation data. 


Using images did not give us good results in resnet18.

used 300x300 images but still no good results.

When using augmented data, we got better results but accuracy reached around 70%.
