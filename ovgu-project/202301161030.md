The normality check was done by applying the Shapiro-Wilk Test. Either t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests were conducted for cross-modal comparisons between gruops, and effect sizes of these tests were also reported as a d value and U[%], which represeted the probability percentage of non-overlap btw two dist.s. Corrs btw measures were calculated using Spearman's coefficiant ($r_s$) and the 95% CI fo the coefficient calculated using a bootstrapping method. The variances explained bt the correlations ($r_s^2$) were also calculated and reported. Receiver operating characteristics analyses were conducted using R to calculate area under curve (AUC) to discriminate btw controls and glaucoma. Pairwise comparisons of all measures' AUCs were assessed to check for any significant difference btw them. p-values were corrected for multiple testing with adjusted a-levels ($p_a$) using Bonferroni-Holm correction where applicable.


It's better to report with effect sizes.
