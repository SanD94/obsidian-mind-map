# SmoothScroll Trial Reset

There are some registers that need to be changed.
In `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\SmoothScroll_is1`, `InstallDate` value should change to future dates.

In `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SmoothScroll`, there are two values related to install date and trial end date. If you also change these values, SmoothScroll runs without giving any warning as much as you want.
