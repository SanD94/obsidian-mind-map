# Vision Journal Club Notes (not completed)

## Sensitivity to chromatic and luminance contrast and its neuronal substrates

contrast sensitivity function (CSF), sinewaves define
temporal CSF, (t)CSF measured by temporally modulating a uniform field
spatial CSF, (s)CSF measured by free viewing of stationary gratings (sinewave modulated patterns) of different spatial frequencies.

luminance CSF and chromatic CSF are different. They have different processing mechanisms in human vision. Luminance CSF, bandpass in shape and chromatic CFS lowpass.

Parasol cells form the basis of magnocellular (MC) pathway, summing L-cone and M-cone input.
The parvocellular (PC) pathway begins in midget ganglion cells and get $|M-L|$ input.

Small-bistratified cells with excitatory S-cone input (and inhibitory L+M input) form part of koniocellular (KC) pathway.
