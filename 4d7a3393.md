# Thesis Introduction Notes

Tool use literature, little information

Cardinali 2009 -> bodily perception was found to be changed via tool use.

Sposito 2012 -> extension of our bodies.

change in perceiving environment ->  Berti (2000), Farne(2005), Witt(2005), Canzoneri(2013)


VR allows us to manipulate both object properties and agent characteristics while studying the interaction between agents and their environments. An environment could potentially be designed in infinitely many ways. In a VR setting, the experimenter has precise control over the manipulation of the responses of an object to physical forces, as well as the object’s shape, color, size, texture, location, or movement. Since the VR headset completely blocks the visual image coming from the physical world in VR experiment, potential confounding factors such as lighting, context, distances in proportion to the subject’s body, and the angle where the participant sees the object can also be carefully controlled. Moreover, the form and capabilities of an agent can be manipulated via an avatar, which is a virtual representation of the body and its movements in a virtual environment. Avatars provide a sense of presence and agency in virtual environments, where the agent can interact with objects by using, for instance, virtual hands or controllers. 

Why we are doing these studies...

Cisek (1999) criticized the field of psychology by claiming that psychologists study human as a segregated organism from its environment and address different segments of the behavior (i.e., perception, action, and cognition) in isolation. Cognitive science studies provide a rather multidisciplinary perspective to the areas of research that are tackled by different fields of studies independently. The purpose of this study is to examine interactive behavior by using the methods of experimental psychology. The potential implications of the results for the VR applications are also discussed. First, I will provide a scientific background for the flexibility of our perception of the body and its capabilities and how that flexibility affects the way we perceive our environment within the context of affordances. I will then present a reliable way of measuring affordances and using VR for this purpose as a research tool. 

## Judjments for reachability are independent fo visuomotor adaptation

Reachability changes after tool use or judging incorrectly the position of the hand. visual feedback about the hand (changing)

Reachability is not related to visuomotor adaptation.

Participants then judge objects to be closer than when no tool is used (Witt et al 2005; but see de Grave et al 2011). This suggests that tool-use expands the representation of the participant's limb so that it encompasses the entire tool (Ackroyd et al 2002; Berti and Frassinetti 2000; Pegna et al 2001) or at least encompasses the end-effector (Collins et al 2008; Holmes et al 2004, 2007; reviewed in Higuchi et al 2006 and in Holmes and Spence 2004)

Passively holding a tool does not change what is perceived to be in the reachable space. Active tool use is required but that's not the always the case. For example, laser pointer. (Berti and Frassinetti 2000; Gamberini et al 2008; Longo and Lourenco 2006). No straihtforward mechanical connection between the hand and the endpoint of the laser beam.

that is perceived to be within reach

rubber hand illusion is also included.(Holmes and Spence 2004).
the real rubber hand illusion (Botvinick and Cohen 1998). The fact that people combine the seen and felt positions of the hand to judge where their hand is in space suggests that shifting visual feedback about the position of the hand will shift judgments of reachability.


Flight zone ve working space üzerinden de ele alabilirsin. Normalde obstacle flight zone üzerine giriyor da olabilir. Onun üzerinden bir değerlendirme yapmak da tez ve makale için uygun olacaktır.

### Perception in VR

Digital technologies such as virtual reality (VR) whereby an artificial or modulated environment created by computer
software can be presented to a user in such a way
that they make-believe it to be real offers the
opportunity of creating an experimental system
where stimulus variables can be manipulated
independently, for example through the introduction
of temporal delays. VR and mixed reality (MR)
have been used to investigate the RHI.



### Rubber Hand Illusion

RHI (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998)

#### The Digital Rubber Hand Illusion
Aldhous, Hetherington and Turner (2017)

They replicated the RHI phenomenon in the VR with the same perceptual effect as in the Rubber Hand.

RHI is an interaction between vision, touch and proprioception, inter-modal matching is sufficient for the illusion.

Kilteni et al (2015) -> a review article for body ownership  
**first explanation** :suggests spatiotemporal congruence between seen and felt stimuli is enough for illsuions using visuotactile stimuli


**second explanation**: "plasticity" of the body schema (e.g. Gallagher, 2005, Metzinger, 2004)
There is a body schema which represents the locations of the all body parts. but the schema is plastic, which means it is updated through interactions with the environment. 


One method for rubber hand illusion in MR and VR
Participants were shown a rubber hand stimulating with a brush as a projection. in the MR condition, participants saw a virtual hand stimulated on the table. In these conditions, the effect was not strong enough as in the case where rubber hand was used. (Ijsselstein et al, 2006).

(van der Hoort et al, 2011), people perceive that they own a body different than their real one, such as toy doll or a giant.
